## Introduction
This project uses a dataset of animals and their associated features to demonstrate the use of entropy in decision trees for feature selection. The program selects the most informative features and outputs the best feature to use for classification based on the entropy values.

## Features
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates entropy for uniform distributions to aid feature selection.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies the most informative feature for classification using entropy values.
- **Modular Code**: Code is structured for easy extension and modifications.
- **Unit Testing**: Pre-defined tests ensure that the key functionalities work as expected.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- pytest

## Testing
pytest test_public.py
